# New issues

If you are submitting an issue for a failed build, please check that:

 1. The project is set up for automatic builds: 
    - There is a build file in the repository (build.gradle, pom.xml, etc.)
    - The build file is properly configured https://jitpack.io/docs/BUILDING/
 2. The project builds locally on your machine. For example: 
    - Gradle: `./gradlew install`
    - Maven: `mvn install`
 3. You have found the error in the build log and searched this repository for similar issues
 
Thank you!
