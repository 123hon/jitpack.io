JitPack currently can build Gradle and Maven projects. Support for other build frameworks is coming later on.

Gradle builds
=============

Projects using Gradle need to have either the `maven` plugin or the `maven-publishing` plugin enabled.




Maven builds
=============

JitPack will run: 

    mvn install
    
to build and publish Maven projects.
